Includes social sharing buttons before/after post content.

== Description ==

Cap Social Buttons is Just Another Social Plugin. Its main feature is a cleanest as possible output code.

We've been careful to:

* Keep the CSS styling done by the plugin at the minimum.
* Keep the HTML output by the plugin clean and concise (again, as possible)
* Look another way while adding the JavaScript calls required by the social services.

Cap Social Buttons can currently output buttons for the following actions:

* Facebook like
* Twiter Share
* Google Plus One

With Cap Social Buttons you can:

* Define options for each button
* Put the buttons automatically before/after/both/none sides of the content
* Print the buttons from your theme using `social_buttons_the_buttons`.
* Choose html5/xfbml/... ouput when available

Cap Social Buttons requires Wordpress >= 3.3.2 or better and PHP >= 5.2.

== Installation ==


1. Upload the `social_buttons` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure as needed
